# LabLife clone for use in BrenneckeLab at IMBA

This is not an open-source clone of LabLife, but only a rebuilt of a single part of its functionality - a wet-lab Plasmid tracking app.

Built on top Rails 3.2 using Ruby 1.9.3. There are no tests available, thus it is unclear exactly how production ready it is. You have been warned..
